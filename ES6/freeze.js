// As seen in the previous challenge, const declaration alone doesn't really protect your data from mutation. To ensure your data doesn't change, JavaScript provides a function Object.freeze to prevent data mutation.

// Once the object is frozen, you can no longer add, update, or delete properties from it. Any attempt at changing the object will be rejected without an error.

let obj = {
  name:"FreeCodeCamp",
  review:"Awesome"
};
Object.freeze(obj);
obj.review = "bad";
obj.newProp = "Test";
console.log(obj); 

//another example 

function freezeObj() {
    const MATH_CONSTANTS = {
      PI: 3.14
    };
    // Only change code below this line
  Object.freeze(MATH_CONSTANTS)
  
    // Only change code above this line
    try {
      MATH_CONSTANTS.PI = 99;
    } catch(ex) {
      console.log(ex);
    }
    return MATH_CONSTANTS.PI;
  }
  const PI = freezeObj();
